# KEdit
This is a fork of [Ekit](https://github.com/hexidec/Ekit) - The original Open Source Java-based HTML Editor. This version of Ekit shares the editor as **JPanel** so you can use it to your project.

## Swing HTML Editor
This editor can be run or included to your project.

If you want run you follow by @hexidec [instructions](https://github.com/hexidec/Ekit/blob/master/com/hexidec/ekit/README.txt#L284).
If you want use it in your project you have to use KEdit class (`pl.koder95.kedit.KEdit` - extends `javax.swing.JPanel`).
